## Problem H: Secret Code

### Explanation

We are given a string `s` and need to find the number of strictly increasing sequences of character positions `p_1, p_2, ..., p_k` that satisfy two conditions:
1. The character at each position `p_i` (for `1 <= i < k`) must be 'a'.
2. Between any two consecutive positions `p_i` and `p_{i+1}`, there must exist at least one character 'b'. That is, there is a `j` such that `p_i < j < p_{i+1}` and `s[j] == 'b'`.

We need to output the total count of such sequences modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Idea

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Let `dp[i]` be the number of valid sequences ending at index `i` (where `s[i]` is 'a').

Let's iterate through the string `s` from left to right.

We need to keep track of two counts:
- `count_a`: The number of valid sequences ending with an 'a' that *could* be the start of a new segment (i.e., `p_i`).
- `count_ab`: The number of valid sequences ending with an 'a' that *have already had a 'b' after them* and are ready to be followed by another 'a' (i.e., `p_i` followed by a 'b' and then we are looking for `p_{i+1}`).

Let `total_sequences` be the final answer.

When we encounter a character `s[i]`:

- If `s[i] == 'a'`:
    - We can start a new sequence with this 'a'. So, `count_a` increases by 1 (for the single-element sequence `(i)`).
    - This 'a' can also extend existing sequences that have already seen a 'b' after their previous 'a'. So, `count_a` also increases by `count_ab`.
    - `total_sequences` increases by `count_a` (because any sequence ending with this 'a' is a valid sequence).

- If `s[i] == 'b'`:
    - Any sequence ending with an 'a' that we have counted in `count_a` can now be extended by this 'b'. This means these sequences are now ready to be followed by another 'a'. So, `count_ab` increases by `count_a`.
    - `count_a` resets to 0, because any 'a' that was waiting for a 'b' has now found one, and those sequences are now represented in `count_ab`.

All additions should be performed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Let's refine the DP state:
`dp_a[i]` = number of valid sequences ending at index `i` where `s[i] == 'a'`, and this 'a' is the `p_k` of the sequence.
`dp_b[i]` = number of valid sequences ending at index `i` where `s[i] == 'b'`, and this 'b' is the `s_j` (noise character) for some `p_i` and `p_{i+1}`.

This seems more complex than necessary. Let's stick to the `count_a` and `count_ab` idea.

Initialize `count_a = 0`, `count_ab = 0`, `total_sequences = 0`.
Iterate `i` from `0` to `len(s) - 1`:
  If `s[i] == 'a'`:
    `current_a_sequences = (1 + count_ab) % MOD` (1 for starting a new sequence, `count_ab` for extending sequences that already had a 'b')
    `total_sequences = (total_sequences + current_a_sequences) % MOD`
    `count_a = (count_a + current_a_sequences) % MOD` (This `count_a` accumulates all sequences ending in 'a' that are currently waiting for a 'b')
  If `s[i] == 'b'`:
    `count_ab = (count_ab + count_a) % MOD` (All sequences ending in 'a' now have a 'b' after them)
    `count_a = 0` (These sequences are now in `count_ab`, no longer waiting for a 'b')

Example: `s = abbaa`
MOD = 10^9 + 7

Initial: `count_a = 0`, `count_ab = 0`, `total_sequences = 0`

i = 0, `s[0] = 'a'`:
  `current_a_sequences = (1 + 0) = 1`
  `total_sequences = (0 + 1) = 1` (Sequence: (0))
  `count_a = (0 + 1) = 1`
  `count_ab = 0`

i = 1, `s[1] = 'b'`:
  `count_ab = (0 + 1) = 1` (Sequence: (0) followed by 'b' at index 1)
  `count_a = 0`
  `total_sequences = 1`

i = 2, `s[2] = 'b'`:
  `count_ab = (1 + 0) = 1` (Still (0) followed by 'b' at index 1, or (0) followed by 'b' at index 2)
  `count_a = 0`
  `total_sequences = 1`

i = 3, `s[3] = 'a'`:
  `current_a_sequences = (1 + 1) = 2` (Sequences: (3), (0, 3) - (0,3) is valid because (0) was followed by 'b' at index 1 or 2)
  `total_sequences = (1 + 2) = 3` (Sequences: (0), (3), (0, 3))
  `count_a = (0 + 2) = 2`
  `count_ab = 1`

i = 4, `s[4] = 'a'`:
  `current_a_sequences = (1 + 1) = 2` (Sequences: (4), (0, 4) - (0,4) is valid because (0) was followed by 'b' at index 1 or 2)
  `total_sequences = (3 + 2) = 5` (Sequences: (0), (3), (0, 3), (4), (0, 4))
  `count_a = (2 + 2) = 4`
  `count_ab = 1`

Final `total_sequences = 5`. This matches the example.

This DP approach seems correct. The time complexity will be O(N) where N is the length of the string, as we iterate through the string once. Space complexity is O(1).
