## Problem I: Do you where is Naseem?

### Explanation

Naseem is one of `n` contestants in a superhero team. He leaves the contest. The task is to determine how many members of his team are still in the contest after he leaves.

### Idea

This is a straightforward arithmetic problem. If there are `n` members in the team initially, and one member (Naseem) leaves, then the number of remaining members in the team is simply `n - 1`.

For each test case, read the value of `n` and print `n - 1`.
