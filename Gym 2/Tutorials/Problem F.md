## Problem F: Two Arrays Game

### Problem Understanding

This problem describes a game played with two arrays, `a` and `b`, of length `n`. The game involves a chessboard-like structure where values `a_i` and `b_j` are associated with rows and columns. The core of the problem lies in understanding how Mike and Harvey's moves affect the values and how they aim to maximize/minimize `a_k - b_k`.
