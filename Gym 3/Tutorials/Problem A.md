## Problem A: Omar and segments
This problem asks us to find the minimum position of a given value `x` within a specified range `[l, r]` in an array `A`.

### Solution
A naive approach would be to iterate through the given range for each query, which would result in a time complexity of O(N*Q) in the worst case, where N is the size of the array and Q is the number of queries. Given the constraints (N, Q up to 10^5), this approach would be too slow (10^10 operations).

A more efficient approach involves pre-processing the array or using a data structure that can handle range queries. Since we need the *minimum position*, and not just existence, a simple hash map for values to positions won't work directly for ranges. However, we can use a `vector<int>` to store the indices for each value. For example, `positions[value]` would be a sorted list of indices where `value` appears in the array.

For each query `(l, r, x)`:
1.  Retrieve the list of positions for `x` from `positions[x]`.
2.  Perform a binary search (specifically, `lower_bound`) on this list to find the first position that is greater than or equal to `l`.
3.  If such a position exists and it is less than or equal to `r`, then this is our minimum position within the range. Otherwise, `x` is not found in the range, and we output -1.

This approach would have a pre-processing time of O(N) to build the position lists and O(Q * log N) for queries, which is efficient enough.
