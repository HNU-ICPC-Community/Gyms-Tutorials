## Problem G: Super Palindrome

### Problem Understanding

This problem involves analyzing and transforming a binary string (a string consisting of '0's and '1's) and then counting certain patterns. The code processes the string in two main phases, accumulating a count (`cnt`) in each phase.

It seems the problem asks to calculate a specific value `cnt` after two transformations/analyses of the input string `s` of length `n`.
